0,"How much additional food production does the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimate is needed by 2050 compared with 2010, under the current global food-system assumptions?","['The rapid growth in agricultural productivity since the 1960s has underpinned the development of the current global food system that is both a major driver of climate change, and increasingly vulnerable to it (from production, transport, and market activities). Given the current food system, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that there is a need to produce about 50% more food by 2050 in order to feed the increasing world population (FAO 2018a2). This would engender significant increases in GHG emissions and other environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity. FAO (2018a) projects that by 2050 cropland area will increase 90–325 Mha, between 6% and 21% more than the 1567 Mha cropland area of 2010, depending on climate change scenario and development pathway (the lowest increase arises from reduced food loss and waste and adoption of more sustainable diets).', 'The need to produce about 50% more food by 2050, required to feed the increasing world population (FAO 2018a1138), may come at the price of significant increases in GHG emissions and environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity. For instance, land conversion for agriculture is responsible for an estimated 8–10% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions currently (Section 5.4). Recent calls for sustainable intensification (SI) are based on the premise that damage to the environment through extensification outweighs benefits of extra food produced on new lands (Godfray 20151139). However, increasing the net production area by restoring already degraded land may contribute to increased production on the one hand and increased carbon sequestration on the other (Jat et al. 20161140), thereby contributing to both increased agricultural production and improved natural capital outcomes (Pretty et al. 20181141).', 'production compared with the DIA-GIO model, as other sectors (eg, pet food and industrial sectors) increase their demand for animal-based and_ plant-based products (appendix 5 p 43). Livestock demand for animal feeds declines in the EAT—Lancet scenario (-3%) from around 2-5 billion tonnes in 2020, to 2-4 billion tonnes by 2050. This reduction is especially notable compared with the BAU scenario, which predicts a 39% increase in feed production (to around 3-5 billion tonnes).', 'Across the model ensemble, the BAU scenario shows a 37% increase in global agricultural production by 2050 compared with 2020 (figure 11A). Livestock production increases by around 33%, and crops by 37%. All regions see increased overall agricultural production by 2050 compared with 2020 values, with the largest increases in sub-Saharan Africa (around 100%) and the smallest increases in China (11% for the model ensemble and 18% for DIA-GIO) and Europe (18% for the model ensemble and 16% for']",The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that about 50% more food will need to be produced by 2050 compared with 2010 to feed the increasing world population.

1,"According to Chapter 5, what range of cropland area increase is projected by FAO by 2050 (under certain assumptions) and what is the 2010 baseline cropland area?","['The rapid growth in agricultural productivity since the 1960s has underpinned the development of the current global food system that is both a major driver of climate change, and increasingly vulnerable to it (from production, transport, and market activities).

Hasegawa et al. (2018)410 found that declining agricultural productivity broadly leads to the need for additional cropland, with 7 of 8 models projecting increasing cropland and the median increase by 2050 projected across all models of 2% compared to a no climate change reference (Figure 5.7). Not all regions will respond to climate impacts equally, with more uncertainty on regional land-use change across the model ensemble than the global totals might suggest. For example, the median land-use change for Latin America is an increase of cropland by 3%, but the range across the model ensemble is significant, with three models projecting declines in cropland (–25 to –1%) compared to the five models projecting cropland increase (0–5%). For further discussion on land-use change and food security see Section 5.6.', 'Avoiding food loss and waste will contribute to reducing emissions from the agriculture sector. By 2050, agricultural GHG emissions associated with production of food that might be wasted may increase to 1.9–2.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1 (Hiç et al. 2016928). When land-use change for agriculture expansion is also considered, halving food loss and waste reduces the global need for cropland area by around 14% and GHG emissions from agriculture and land-use change by 22–28% (4.5 GtCO2-eq yr–1) compared to the baseline scenarios by 2050 (Bajželj et al. 2014929). The GHG emissions mitigation potential of food loss and waste reduction would further increase when lifecycle analysis accounts for emissions throughout food loss and waste through all food system activities.', 'Most scenarios assume very rapid deployment between 2030 and 2050, reaching rates of expansion in land use in 1.5°C scenarios exceeding 20 Mha yr-1, which are unprecedented for crops and forestry reported in the FAO database from 1961. Achieving the 1.5°C target would thus result in major competing demands for land between climate change mitigation and food production, with cascading impacts on food security.']","The FAO projects that by 2050, cropland area will increase by 90–325 million hectares, which is between 6% and 21% more than the 2010 baseline cropland area of 1,567 million hectares.","The projected cropland area increase: 90–325 million ha (between 6% and 21%) above the 2010 baseline of 1,567 Mha.",0.9908596305881355,0.9634385223525421,1.0,0.9239778795390188,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.8,0.9999999999,1.0
