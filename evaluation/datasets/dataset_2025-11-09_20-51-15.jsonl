It is critical to recognize that sectors are in fact part of an interconnected system. A system is a set of components in dynamic interaction that delivers a number of functions. The core function of the food system is to bring food and agricultural products from production to human use and consumption. Food systems also deliver other functions, such as nutrition, ecosystem services, livelihoods and social cohesion. The need to consider all of these functions is one of the reasons why working in food systems is so complex. There may be trade-offs between them that need to be managed to ensure an overall positive impact across different agendas and systems. Moreover, each component of the system influences and is influenced by the others through multiple interconnections, creating a dynamic and frequently unpredictable structure that may also necessitate experimentation and learning by doing.
